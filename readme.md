Tools used for Implementation:
Python, Postgres,  Apollo GraphQL API, Flask web server

I went ahead with Python due to it's simple and amazing exchange of resources to integrate the environemnts of Google Cloud, Postgres, a GraphQL API and Flask web server. 
Python has great interoperability with these tools to deliver on accomplishment of the task which is heavily data based.
Python has a Command Line Interface for accessing Google Cloud called "gs" which was used to fetch csv data.
Libraies such as ariadne was perfect for Python and defining schemas from scratch for GraphQL API implementation.
SQLAlchemy was used for Postgres integration into the Python environment.
Pandas was used for data manipulation and processing parallel mechanisms.
Flask library was used for ease of setup of web server for GraphQL API setup.

I must say this excercise was a very good one and focuses on the importance of performance scaling using the right tools with a focus on the right hardware resouces when processing massive amount of data.
On my attempt to do the operation, I realize hardware specifications are utmost important.
The computer I had used for this operation has 12gb Ram with Intel i7 Core and 256 SSD NVMe drive & 2TB Internal Hard Disk.
Internet Speed was very important also.
I had to pay attention to limits of my hardware specifications and design the code to process the data in batches to utilize the available resources.

Performance Metrics include:

First up tho, I had tried to use Python with Google Cloud CLI to fetch the data from Google Cloud directly into memory to push to Postgres, but this was too expensive.
I decided best to to fetch csv objects and store unto my local computer.
This process was completed in about 2 hrs 30 mins with my current internet speed at 10MB/s. 
if I opted for high internet speed then this time could be cut in half.
1282 csv objects in the token-transfer folder and 1 csv object in token folder with combined size of approximately 64.5GB 

Python was used to prepare csv objects in batches and Push to Postgres database where 219,222,954 rows inserted.
This operation was completed in about 2 hours with current hardware spefications as described.

For the purposes of a Production Application, there needs to be careful consideration of the tools/stack to be used for implementation since focus is on performing operations on massive amount of structures and unstructured data across multiple environments. I really like how the mentioned tools (Python, Postgres, Apollo GraphQL API, Flask Web) work together to get the operation done from scratch. More tests could be done to compare performance of other popular tools such as Node.JS in integrating massive amount of data from various API systems.

5.
Docker/ Kubernetes are most popular deployment platforms to package the core of the final application to make sure proper functioning across various environments.
